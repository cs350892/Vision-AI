**Project Overview: VisionAI**  

VisionAI is an AI-powered accessibility platform designed to empower visually impaired individuals by enhancing their independence and daily functionality. Built by **Team Trio Developer** during **Techathon Feb 22 2025**, VisionAI integrates advanced AI technologies to address real-world challenges faced by the visually impaired community.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Braille-to-Speech:** Converts Braille images into audible speech.  
- **Smart Navigation:** AI-driven obstacle detection for safe movement.  
- **Currency Reader:** Identifies and announces currency denominations.  
- **Document Reader:** Reads text from uploaded documents aloud.  
- **Voice Assistant:** Hands-free interaction with all features.  

**How It Works:**  
1. Users upload images (Braille, documents, or currency) or use real-time camera input.  
2. VisionAI‚Äôs AI processes the input and extracts meaningful information.  
3. The app delivers the output in an audible format, making it accessible.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **AI/ML:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **APIs:** Google Cloud Vision, Text-to-Speech  

**Future Roadmap:**  
- Real-time camera input for instant reading.  
- Global currency recognition.  
- Enhanced obstacle detection.  
- Mobile app development.
